## Project Overview:
Welcome to my web scraping project that extracts data from the [List of Largest Companies in the United States by Revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue). The project utilizes Python, the Beautiful Soup library for web scraping, and the Pandas library for data manipulation. The scraped data is then saved to a CSV file.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how web scraping can be used to gather valuable information from websites and present it in a structured format.
